## Installation

Use the following terminal command to clone the project on your local machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:ricardoschalkwyk/Capstone.git

I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to open the project and running it using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.

Once the project is open, install the following extension

When clicking right-click you will see an option to open a live server which will automatically update the page when saving.
