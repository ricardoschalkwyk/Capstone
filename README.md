## Installation

Use the following terminal command to clone the project on your local machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:ricardoschalkwyk/Capstone.git
```

I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to open the project and running it using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.

Once the project is open, install the following extension
[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

When clicking right-click you will see an option to open a live server which will automatically update the page when saving.

## Usage

All items in the navigtion bar are clickable, from there you can nagivate to every page.

You can add items to the cart by clicking on any of the `Add to cart` buttons.

The cart itself has different options you can use to change the quantity & pricing of the added items.

Items within the cart can also be removed with the `Remove` button.

The `Qty` option allows you to change the quantity of items added.
